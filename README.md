# gitTastic
This project makes use of giphy's api key to populate gifs from chosen search buttons (in this case 2019 movies).  The search button allows the user to create a new button and append it to the browser allowing corresponding gif displays.

The next portion to be completed is having the gifs animate and pause when clicked.
